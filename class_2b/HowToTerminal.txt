::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

OPEN THE TERMINAL:

	1. 	Command-Space
	2. 	Type Terminal
	3.  Press Enter

WOAH WHERE ARE WE?
	This is the command line.
	We can use the command line to tell the computer to do things,
	and we can use it to browse our file system.
	This is your home directory (a director is a folder), some
	of our favorite folders are stored here:
		
		Documents
		Downloads
		Movies
		Music
		Pictures (etc.)
	
	The home directory is where your finder usually starts
	when you open a new finder window. You can do a few things 
	from the command line to find out more about your current
	location...keep reading!

COMMANDS
	
	ls -- typing these two letters and hitting enter will show you a
		  list of what folders and files are in your current directory.
		  Type ls and check what folders and files are in the home 
		  directory. Files have an extension (.jpeg, .txt, .py), directories
		  (folders) do not.

    cd -- this command stands for Change Directory (cd). It allows you to
          go into a directory that is listed when you use ls. 
          Try typing:	

          	cd Documents
          
          Then press enter. You are now in the Documents folder.
          To go up a level type:

          	cd ..

          Now you are back in the home directory!

    pwd -- just type pwd (print working directory) with nothing after it and
           you might see:

    	   		Users/<you name>/Documents		if you are in the Documents Folder or
    	   		Users/<your name>				if you are in the home directory

    	   That is your current location!
    	   After each slash is another directory you have cd'd into. 
    	   Note: sometimes the home directory is denoted with a ~ (tilda) the
    	   top level directory in your filesystem is denoted with a / (slash).

    With these three commands you can pretty much navigate your entire computer
    and see all the files and folders that make up your filesystem.

    Wanna try something cool? go to your ~/Documents folder (home directory then
    cd into Documents). Use ls to look at all of your files. Now type the following:

    	open <some file in your Documents folder>

    If you did this right you computer will use the default application for that
    type of file to open the file. If you use open on a directory it will open 
    that folder in the finder.
