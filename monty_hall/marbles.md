## The Problem Statement

You have two fish tanks full of marbles (an equal number in each.) One is full of red marbles, the other blue marbles. You take a coffee mug full of marbles from the blue tank and pour them into the red tank. After mix them, you take a coffee mug of the mixed marbles and pour it back into the original blue tank. (The coffee mugs always move the same number of marbles.)

Are there more red marbles in the original blue tank, or blue marbles in the original red tank?
