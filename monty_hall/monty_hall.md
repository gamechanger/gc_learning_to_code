### The Problem Statement

You are on the game show "Let's Make a Deal" and are presented with three doors. You are told that one of the doors has a brand new boat behind it, and the other two have a goat. (You don't want the goat.)

You are asked to select a door, and after selecting one, say door number 2, the host opens one of the remaining doors, say door 3, and reveals a goat. Then the host asks if you would like to switch your selection to the unopened remaining door, door 1 in this case.

Should you switch? In the long run, is switching or staying a better stratgy?
