## Lists: ##
- Making lists with stuff in them

#### Item Access ####

- access just like strings!
- O-indexed
- assignment with `list[index]` syntax, touch on mutability ("this can be changed, strings can't")

#### Length ####

- also just like strings!

#### Iteration ####

- Assume class has seen `for`/`while` before, provide examples with lists

#### Concatenation ####

- `+`

#### Containment ####

- `in`

#### Methods ####

- `.append()`
- `.pop()`
- `.sort()`

## Dicts ##

- Making dicts with stuff in them
- Talk about how they aren't ordered

#### Item Access ####

- access looks like lists and strings!, but is a little bit different.
- assignment is kind of like with lists, but you can add whole items!

#### Iteration ####

- example of iteration over keys
- introduce `.keys()` and `.values()` by way of iteration examples

#### Containment ####

- `in`

## Boundaries and Exceptions ##

#### Lists ####

- Accessing items out of bounds: What happens? How can we decide whether to try accessing a certain index?
- `len` to the rescue!

#### Dicts ####

- Accessing items that aren't present: What happens? How can we decide whether to try accessing a certain index?
- `.get()` and `in` to the rescue!
