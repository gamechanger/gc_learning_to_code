## Things to do For the First Class
1. Go to https://github.com and set up a free account
2. Open 'terminal' application on your mac
    1. Press command+space
    2. Type 'terminal'
    3. Press enter
3. Download git to your computer

    2. On the popup that appears press install button and follow the steps
4. Copy and paste the following lines of code into the terminal application
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/gamechanger/gc_learning_to_code.git
cd gc_learning_to_code
```


## How to Run Code
We are going to be working in Python. To this end, we will be using a program called Idle.

* To start Idle, open the terminal application and type 'idle'
* Idle's python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) will start
* This REPL allows you to enter python commands and get back their output
* Idle also allows you to create new files, open old files, and run python files
* You should familiarize yourself with Idle because we will be using it for the duration of the course


## How to Get Your Questions Answered
We will be trying to use Github's issue tracker to answer questions on the course.
If you have an issue or question here are the steps that you should follow:

1. On the main page of the gc_learning_to_code repo (https://github.com/gamechanger/gc_learning_to_code) look on the right hand side of the page and hit the 'Issues' button in the right hand column
2. Search in issues for a related question that might address your question
3. If you do not see a similar issue, then hit the big, green 'New Issue' button
4. Write the title of the issue or question and give an in depth description of what is going wrong
5. When you file an issue it will ping the \#muggle_coding_help room in slack
6. One of the engineers should see the message and respond to the issue when they get some time.

We want to use this system so that you can more easily see issues that others are having and how they got past them.
