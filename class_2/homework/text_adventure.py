	YOU CAN RUN THIS PROGRAM BY TYPING:

		python text_adventure.py 

	ON THE COMMAND LINE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY THAT THIS FILE IS IN.
	
	In This assignment you will be creating a text based adventure game
	similar to the demo.py file in this repository.
	Your adventure can be about anything! Make it a fun adventure for your
	friends to play through!

	RULES:

	1. 	There must be at least 16 questions in your game (total).
	2. 	Each question must have 2-4 possible choices
	3. 	You must use if/elif/else statements!
	4. 	At the end of the adventure you must ask the user if they want to play
		the game again. If they do play again! (Hint: What can we use if we want
		to continue forever unless we meet a certain condition?)
	5. 	You can't let the user enter anything they want when you ask a question.
		Make sure they only input answers that make sense!

	Play through the demo game to get a feel for how the game should work.
	If you copy and paste my code I will know...And I will sue your ass for 
	copy write infringement!
