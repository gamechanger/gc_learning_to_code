	YOU CAN RUN THIS PROGRAM BY TYPING:

		python text_adventure.py

	ON THE COMMAND LINE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY THAT THIS FILE IS IN.

	In This assignment you will be creating a text based adventure game
	similar to the demo.py file in this repository.
	Your adventure can be about anything! Make it a fun adventure for your
	friends to play through!

	RULES:

	1. 	There must be at least 16 questions in your game (total).
	2. 	Each question must have 2-4 possible choices
	3. 	You must use if/elif/else statements!
	4. 	At the end of the adventure you must ask the user if they want to play
		the game again. If they do play again! (Hint: What can we use if we want
		to continue forever unless we meet a certain condition?)
	5. 	You can't let the user enter anything they want when you ask a question.
		Make sure they only input answers that make sense!

	Play through the demo game to get a feel for how the game should work.

	copy write infringement!


	Example Question:
		You have entered a new room.  In the room there are three objects: a sword, a candle and a note.
		Which object would you like to explore?
	You would continue to ask this question until you get a response of either sword, candle or note.

	Hints:
	    1. How would you keep track of what question to ask (need some sort of state (a variable maybe?))
	    2. Your story only needs to progress forward
	    3. You can place loops inside of other loops
	    	while x:
	    		while y:
