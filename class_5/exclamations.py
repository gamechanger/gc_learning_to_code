Write a function that takes two parameters, `message` and `count`.
The function should return the `message` followed by `count` exclamation points.

def really_excited(message, count):
    # Write your implementation here
    pass # You can delete this line once you write your implementation
    
assert really_excited("Hooray", 3) == "Hooray!!!"
assert really_excited("Bacon", 0) == "Bacon"
assert really_excited("Excelsior", 5) == "Excelsior!!!!!"
print "Problem 1 is finished!"
